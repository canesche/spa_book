    \textbf{\Large{PREFACE}}
\end{center}

This book was based on Professor Fernando Magno Quintão's material. You can access the material at this \hyperlink{https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/classes/dcc888/}{link} and other materials on the website (Please always look in the end of chapter for reference). Fernando was my advisor during my Ph.D., and He created and taught the course DCC888 – Static Program Analysis at UFMG, which I had the pleasure to do. Of course, this book doesn't have the goal to substitute the original material, but maybe complement it. I strongly recommend you read and study the material created by him.

But, Michael, why are you taking so long to finish the book? The image below answers your question :)
