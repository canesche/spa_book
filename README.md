## Introduction

The study of compilers has always been my interest since I graduated in Computer Science (Ahh, good times). This work is a study that I made during my PhD (and I continue studying). I am using this work to practice English and motivate me daily to learn different areas in the compiler. Enjoy the read and feel free to help me in this journey.
